					<h2>Morrison & Foerster Case Study</h2>
					<p>I get it, law firms have more important things to worry about than their website. A lot of firms rely mainly on relationships andword of mouth to win new busines, so often times their website gets neglected. That being said, there are many significant reasons why you need a professionaly designed and developed website.</p>
					<p>The legal services industry is really built around two things: trust & professionalism. When trying to win new business or recruiting talented lawyers from law school, your website is a huge tool in helping establish a feeling of trust and professionalism. See how I was able to change the perception of Morrison & Foerster among industry professionals and current law students with my redesign:</p>

			<h2>Survey Results</h2>
			<p>I was so confident in my work that I hired a third party company to survey current students at top law schools. Is that crazy? Perhaps a bit, but I think it paid off.</p>
			<div class="survey-method">
				<h4>Survey Process</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Reached out to current students at the top law schools and asked them to take an anonymous survey</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Presented survey respondents with Morrison & Foerster's old website design, top competitors websites, and my redesign</p>
						<em>All firm names and logos were changed in the survey and in the website graphics themselves to preserve firm anonymity</em>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Asked them questions about the firms after they reviewed each of the website designs</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
