					<h2>Proposed Redesign</h2>
					<p>We get it, you've got more important things to worry about than your website. On top of that, your high-caliber clients don't run a google search on which law firm to use. Bottom-line, your website is not the lead generation center of your business. That being said, there are other significant reasons why your website should look as professional & awe-inspiring as your physical office spaces.</p>

					<p>We've taken it upon ourselves to redesign your home page, and while we think you'll love the new design, we don't care about that. We care that it brings real results. And when you see the results we've already achieved, we think you'll be convinced.</p>

			<h2>Why should you redesign?</h2>
			<p>Morrison & Foerster is very successful and has plenty of clients. So, why should you care what your website looks like?</p>
			<div class="reasons">
				<div class="reason">
					<h3>Recruiting The Best Talent</h3>
					<p>You know how competitive it is hiring the best attorneys out of law school. You don't want their initial impression of your firm to be that it is outdated and unprofessional. Any little thing can be the difference between a new attorney going to your firm over another.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="reason">
					<h3>Standing Out From Other Firms</h3>
					<p>As we made our way through the Vault 100, it's clear that some firms have seen the importance of a professionally designed website. Don't fall behind. Currently, your website is viewed as less professional than other firms with similar rankings to you. Let us help you with that!</p>

			<h2>Survey Results</h2>
			<p>We were so confident in our work that we hired a third party company to survey current students at top law schools. Is that crazy? Perhaps a bit, but we think it paid off.</p>
			<div class="survey-method">
				<h4>Survey Process</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Reached out to current students at the top law schools and asked them to take an anonymous survey</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Presented survey respondents with your old website design, competitors websites, and our redesign</p>
						<em>All firm names and logos were changed in the survey and in the website graphics themselves to preserve firm anonymity</em>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Asked them questions about the firms after they reviewed each of the website designs</p>
					</li>
